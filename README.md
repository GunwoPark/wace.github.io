            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Monteverde Conservation League (Asociaci√≥n Conservacionista de Monteverde) is a non-profit organization based
                in Costa Rica. Our vision is to conserve, preserve, and rehabilitate tropical ecosystems and their
                biodiversity. We are the proud stewards of the Children's Eternal Rainforest, Costa Rica's largest private
                reserve, spanning 22,600 hectares. Our mission is to protect this precious rainforest and its inhabitants
                for current and future generations.</p>
            <p>Our customers include tourists, families, student groups, researchers, and participants in environmental
                education programs. We offer eco-tours, environmental education programs, and access to the wilderness for
                a truly immersive experience in nature.</p>

            <h2>Our Impact</h2>
            <p>The Children's Eternal Rainforest is home to an astonishing 2% of the world's orchid species, over 3% of the
                butterflies, and almost 5% of the world's birds. Our dedication to conservation plays a crucial role in
                preserving these unique flora and fauna, making a lasting impact on global biodiversity.</p>

            <h2>Our Projects</h2>
            <p>We are committed to aligning our efforts with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Through
                extensive research, we have identified five successful initiatives that address our sustainable impact
                goals. Our focus areas include reconceiving needs, products, and customers to better serve social,
                environmental, and economic needs. One of our key projects is the construction of a revised or new website
                that leverages social media as a form of environmental education and advocacy.</p>
